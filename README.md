# 🦠 COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

## 📘 Project Description

The **COVID-19 Global Data Tracker** is a data analysis project that explores global trends in COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccinations using real-world data. This project helps visualize the pandemic's impact over time and across countries by performing data cleaning, analysis, and creating visual reports using Python.

It is built to demonstrate practical skills in **data science**, using tools like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn, and is suitable for educational or reporting purposes.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- ✅ Import and clean global COVID-19 data
- ✅ Analyze trends over time (cases, deaths, vaccinations)
- ✅ Compare statistics across selected countries (e.g., Kenya, USA, India)
- ✅ Visualize the results using charts and maps
- ✅ Present meaningful insights using markdown explanations in a Jupyter Notebook

---

## 🧰 Tools and Libraries Used

- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- `pandas` – for data cleaning and manipulation
- `matplotlib` – for creating basic plots and line charts
- `seaborn` – for styled visualizations and comparisons
- *(Optional)* `plotly` or `geopandas` – for interactive or geographic maps

## ▶️ How to Run/View the Project

1. **Download Dataset**  
   Visit [Our World in Data](https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data.csv) and download the dataset.

2. **Place in Folder**  
   Save the file as `owid-covid-data.csv` in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook.

3. **Open Notebook**  
   Open the file `COVID19_Global_Tracker_Assignment.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Visual Studio Code with the Jupyter extension.

4. **Run Cells**  
   Run each cell one by one to load the data, clean it, visualize results, and read the insights.

## 📊 Key Insights and Reflections

- The **USA** recorded the highest number of total cases and deaths among the selected countries.
- **India** experienced a significant spike in daily new cases during the second wave in mid-2021.
- **Kenya's** vaccination rates increased steadily after initial delays.
- The **death rate** has decreased over time in most countries, possibly due to better treatment and vaccine availability.
- Visualizing data helps to **understand trends clearly** and supports better decision-making and awareness.

---

## ✅ Final Deliverables

- A well-commented and structured Jupyter Notebook that includes:
  - Code cells for analysis
  - Cleaned and processed COVID-19 data
  - Visualizations of trends and comparisons
  - Markdown explanations summarizing observations
- Optional export to PDF or PowerPoint with screenshots for presentation
